# Pokemon app to recap CRA (create-react-app)

An application to fetch information from the Pokemon API https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/ to Pokédex. Name of the Pokemon, type/s and picture are rendered in cards.

## Concepts practised:
- react hooks
- multiple API calls

## Usage:

Get 20 Pokemons at a time from the API. Next and prev buttons perform a new call.


## Built with:
- REACT
- JXS
- React Boostrap
- axios
- Pokemon API

## Screenshot:

Version 1:

## To do:
- [x] empty favourites list
- [ ] compute weak against based on type

## known bugs:
- [ ] localStorage can only hold an amount of characters, after some pokemons are added to favourites, it crashes. Bug found, as always, by my child, the greatest tester ever. If you are interesting in hiring, contact me :D
